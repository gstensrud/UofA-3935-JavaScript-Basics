Welcome to my JavaScript Level 1 Assignment.

This took me a lot longer than I had anticipated.  I thought that I had a good
understanding of how to write the code, which, I guess, I did not.  I do have a
good understanding of the theory of writing the code, just putting it into practice
is not as easy as I expected.  After going through all the exercises multiple
times, I found this assignment to have taught me how things work better, and 
with more clarity than the exercises.
